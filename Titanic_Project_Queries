# Purpose of Project: To make a descriptive analysis about the survival rate of the passengers of Titanic

# PART 1 : PRE-ANALYSIS

# To find duplicate rows from passengers table

SELECT 
 PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, 
 Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, 
 Fare, Cabin, Embarked, count(*)
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY 
 PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name,
 Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, 
 Fare, Cabin, Embarked
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

# To find the number of NULL Values and Non-NULL Values from age column

SELECT 
 SUM(
  CASE WHEN Age is NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Age Null Values",
 COUNT(Age) AS "Age Non-Null Values" 
FROM passengers

# To find the number of NULL Values and Non-NULL Values from Cabin column

SELECT 
 SUM(CASE WHEN Cabin is NULL 
 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) 
 AS "Cabin Null Values", 
 COUNT(Cabin) AS "Cabin Non-Null
 Values" 
FROM passengers

# To find the number of NULL Values and Non-NULL Values from Embarked column

SELECT 
 SUM(
 CASE WHEN Embarked is NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS "Embarked Null Values" ,
 COUNT(Embarked) AS "Embarked Non-Null Values" 
FROM passengers


#PART 2: ANALYSIS

# Question 1: Which age class has the highest survival rate?

# The total number of passengers in Titanic group by age classification:

SELECT
 COUNT(Name) AS total_passengers,
CASE
 WHEN age < 18 THEN "children"
 WHEN age >= 60 THEN "elderlies"
 WHEN age >= 18 AND AGE < 60 THEN "adult"
END AS age_classification
FROM passengers
GROUP BY age_classification

# Total number of passengers survived the Titanic incident, classified by age

SELECT 
 COUNT(Survived) AS total_survivors,
CASE
 WHEN Age >= 60 THEN "elderlies"
 WHEN Age < 18 THEN "children"
 WHEN Age >= 18 AND Age < 60 THEN "adults"
END AS survivor_age_class
FROM passengers
WHERE Survived = 1
GROUP BY survivor_age_class


Question 2 : Do the female passengers have higher survival rate than male?

#Total number of females and males on Titanic

SELECT 
 Sex AS Gender,
 COUNT(Name) AS Total_passengers 
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY Sex

#Total number of females and males survived after the Titanic incident

SELECT 
 Sex AS Gender, 
 COUNT(Survived) AS Total_survivors
FROM passengers 
WHERE Survived = 1
GROUP BY Sex


#Question 3 : Do the passengers’ Class status influence their survival rate?

#Total number of passengers based on Class

SELECT 
 Pclass AS Passengers_class,
 COUNT(Pclass) AS Total_passengers
FROM passengers 
GROUP BY Pclass

#Total number of passengers survived the Titanic incident based on Class

SELECT 
 Pclass AS Passengers_class
 COUNT(Pclass) AS Total_survivors
FROM passengers 
WHERE Survived = 1 
GROUP BY Pclass


#Question 4 : Which of the three ports of embark has the highest survival rate? And which passengers class dominated the specific port of embark

#Total passengers based on their port of embark and their passengers’ class

SELECT 
 Embarked AS "Port of Embark", 
 Pclass,
 COUNT(Embarked) AS "Total Passengers"
FROM passengers 
GROUP by Embarked, Pclass

#Total number of survivors based on their port of embark and passengers class

SELECT 
 Embarked AS "Port of Embark", 
 Pclass,
 COUNT(Embarked) AS "Number of Survivors"
FROM passengers 
WHERE Survived = 1
GROUP by Embarked, Pclass
